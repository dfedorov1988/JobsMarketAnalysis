Homes are the new frontier for security, with millions of IoT devices connected and accessible on the internet. Many of these devices have old software and are rarely patched. In addition, most IoT devices do not allow installation of endpoint security software. The challenge for Avast is to protect these vulnerable devices while only observing them on the home network!</div><br>\n<div></div><div>Today, the world\u2019s home networks typically consist of a local wifi managed by a home gateway that connects to an ISP network via cable or DSL. As the world moves to 5G, the connectivity of consumer homes is expected to undergo a paradigm shift. The softwarization of the telecom networks will reach into our homes. Much of the home gateway functionality will move to the edge of the telco network, where it will be reborn as software-defined virtual network functions. Moreover, the home networks will have the flexibility to connect via various access technologies such as fiber, cable, and radio links giving rise to the 5G converged core network.</div><br>\n<div></div><div>The future of home IoT security in the 5G architecture plays to Avast\u2019s strength since security is a key differentiator for telecom operators plan to provide security as a software virtual function. As such, the technical challenge for Avast is to implement machine learning based solutions in the edge cloud to analyze and verify network traffic. In case of a security breach, countermeasures need to be triggered automatically. Machine learning is the key piece of the solution as most home networks are not administered by their owners and intelligent automation is the only way to protect millions of smart homes.</div><br>\n<div></div><div>Avast has conceived an architecture to achieve a \u2018Best in the World\u2019 Home IoT Security solution for a 5G deployment. We are building a series of PoCs and trials to validate our solution with operators under real world conditions.</div><br>\n<div></div><div><b>About You :</b></div>\n<div>We are looking for a Data Scientist to help us protect IoT devices in homes around the world.</div><br>\n<div></div><div>Focus of the team will be to analyze the security of devices within a home, by looking at network traffic inside and outside the home. The solutions will be deployed in production servers across many countries and continents, thus an exciting challenge is to handle the diversity of networks, homes and devices. The role has three focus areas: networking, machine learning, and edge cloud.

It has been table stakes for running any modern business. Transactional systems have powered enterprise data management, e-commerce, and were the initial engines for the Internet era.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\n</div><div>As compute technology has expanded, internet services have exploded and massive amounts of data have become available. Multi-structured data from machine sensors, connected devices, click streams, system logs, etc., all with the potential of affording the business significant value needs to be collected, processed and analyzed. However, this data does not fit well into the relational paradigm, in part because it often requires scale-out capability going from terabytes of data to petabytes making it unsuitable for traditional data management systems.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\n</div><div>These new sources of data drove new SQL - no SQL development, new no SQL databases, and also systems such as Hadoop that have become popular over the last three to five years. Fundamentally, enterprises really want and need to derive value out of the data for the business; often times as a combination of traditional and new data sources Once joined, this combination can provide new insights and be mined with technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\n</div><div>In short, this is what we're aiming for with the next generation of Big Data technology.
